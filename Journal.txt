27/5/25 - Set up the repo for the Hunt the Wumpus project
Spent some time learning about the original projet 1973 game.
Created the cave class document and wrote the first attributes (name and description)

30/5/25 - Write the main.py program to call the class and make the first cave object. Modified the attributes to set up name on installation.
Wrote setter and getter methods for each attributes. Started planning the layout of the caves.
2/6/25 - Wrote a dictionary attribute to store the links to other cave objects.
Wrote and tested a method to print the linked_caves dictionary to the terminal

3/6/25 - Added code to the main program to allow the player to move between different cave objects. Set up a new character class and test program.
Created 'Blorpington - The Wumpus Character' in the test program and tested the conversation method.

4/6/25 - Created the Enemy sub-class (of Character) and added its own methods for setting and getting the Enemy's weakness.
Wrote a method for fight() that overrides the fight() method in the super-class. Updated the char_text code to test the new subclass objects (particularly the weakness and fight methods).

6/6/25 - Finished testing the character in the char_test.py file. Added Blorpington object to the main program and added it to the dungeono object.
Reworked the main loop to accept different inputs (moving, talking and fighting) - still need to finish the code to manage fighting.

11/6/25 - Worked on fixing the two parameters in character.py and started fixing the "declining the fight" command in character.py.

17/6/25 - Began changing the cave variable to area, and reworded cave.py to map.py. 
Temporarily removed all combat and the enemy class. Began modifying the areas and changed the name from "Hunt the Blorpington" to "Journey to the Core".
Added the clear_console (Work in progress) and modified the get_details.

18/6/25 - Fixed the clear_console() and working on fixing the directions showing as "South" instead of showing "is South".
Continued fixing the directions, and copied all the cave areas into main_test to test the areas after cave as well as fixing the link_areas.
Finished the clear_console() and still work in progress with modifying the print() for all Areas as well as Cardinal & Ordinal directions.
