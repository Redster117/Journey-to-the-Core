27/5/25 - Set up the repo for the Hunt the Wumpus project
Spent some time learning about the original projet 1973 game.
Created the cave class document and wrote the first attributes (name and description)

30/5/25 - Write the main.py program to call the class and make the first cave object. Modified the attributes to set up name on installation.
Wrote setter and getter methods for each attributes. Started planning the layout of the caves.
2/6/25 - Wrote a dictionary attribute to store the links to other cave objects.
Wrote and tested a method to print the linked_caves dictionary to the terminal

3/6/25 - Added code to the main program to allow the player to move between different cave objects. Set up a new character class and test program.
Created 'Blorpington - The Wumpus Character' in the test program and tested the conversation method.

4/6/25 - Created the Enemy sub-class (of Character) and added its own methods for setting and getting the Enemy's weakness.
Wrote a method for fight() that overrides the fight() method in the super-class. Updated the char_text code to test the new subclass objects (particularly the weakness and fight methods).

6/6/25 - Finished testing the character in the char_test.py file. Added Blorpington object to the main program and added it to the dungeono object.
Reworked the main loop to accept different inputs (moving, talking and fighting) - still need to finish the code to manage fighting.

11/6/25 - Worked on fixing the two parameters in character.py and started fixing the "declining the fight" command in character.py.

17/6/25 - Began changing the cave variable to area, and reworded cave.py to map.py. 
Temporarily removed all combat and the enemy class. Began modifying the areas and changed the name from "Hunt the Blorpington" to "Journey to the Core".
Added the clear_console (Work in progress) and modified the get_details.

18/6/25 - Fixed the clear_console() and working on fixing the directions showing as "South" instead of showing "is South".
Continued fixing the directions, and copied all the cave areas into main_test to test the areas after cave as well as fixing the link_areas.
Finished the clear_console() and still work in progress with modifying the print() for all Areas as well as Cardinal & Ordinal directions.

21/6/25 - Added flake8 to clean errors and find more detailed errors to fix (resulting in better and cleaner code format), and completely modified the def get_details to fix giving the directions and area names in main_test.py.
Added two commands:
- "N" = Tells the user which direction (Uses an 8 point compass) is the user currently facing.
- "M" = Prints an 8 Point Compass and whatever direction the user is facing, the direction colour is changed to yellow, e.g. 
    If user is facing South, the word colour is changed to Yellow (colour can be changed through main_test.py)

IMPORTANT NOTE: All WIP for linked_areas, and area_name's are being worked on in the main_test.py. 
Once the linked_areas and area_name codes' are finished, they will be transferred to the officail main.py.

1/7/25 - Added an ASCII map in the code as well as fixing the hidded directions. Evening progress: continued fixing the progress (ascii) map including its format.
My aim is to create an ascii map similar to the excel file I created for areas and directions.
e.g.

            __________
            |  Cave  |
            ----------
                |
            __________
            |  East  |     _________
            |  South | --> | Small |
            ----------     |Opening| --> etc.
                |          ---------
                V
            __________
            |  Dark  |
            | Tunnel |
            ----------
2/7/25 - Removed flake8 and fixed the map format, currently fixing the yellow colour for the map
22/7/25 - Fixed the yellow colour issue in the main_test.py file, and the box function is now defined correctly.
23/7/25 - Fixing the map layout still and fixed the small opening box size
24/7/25 - Continued fixing the map layout and adding the First split to the graphical map.
25/7/25 - Fixed the map layout for First split and now moving on with adding other areas including corridors and tunnels.
26/7/25 - Fixed the error with the map layout printing duplicates of Dark tunnel and First Fork (Changed the name Split to Fork).
Changed the two commands "M", "N" to "map", "cp" or "compass".
Fixed the yellow colour bug for The Small Opening and added all corridors and tunnels for South Path after First Fork in the map layout.
Added arrows, vertical & horizontal lines, corners, and corner connectors e.g ◆───◆

27/7/25 - Fixed error with discovered_area The Dark Tunnel having effects on opening map whether discovered or not.
WIP with adding temporary dev commands for teleporting to specific areas whilst discovering any skipped areas. Also adding Southern Dead End later.
Updated testing map 1 (# = Level)

29/7/25 - Added loop in deeper cave (Level 2)in fourth fork, fixed the northern corridor 3. Added the zigzag and dead end in the map layout.
Created more areas from Fifth Fork - South Path to Infernal Hollow (Level 3), which results in a total of 49 areas created.
WIP: Adding areas Fifth Fork - South Path to Infernal Hollow to the map layout, create a draft map for the new and final level "Infernal Hollow" in excel.
Updated testing map 2 (# = Level)
